        My name is Mitchell Hurley, I am 19 years old, my pronouns are He/Him and I am a sophmore at UPS.</p> 
        Some of my favorite things are: NBA basketball, Music (of all genres), Cyberbullying DJ Khaled, And More!
        In my free time, I love to do crossword puzzles, but I constantly cheat on them
        When I was little, I would follow my dad to job sites he was working on as an architect. 
        I would collect <em>rusty nails and broken glass</em> for fun. Not as cool as stamps or coins, but a lot more plentiful
