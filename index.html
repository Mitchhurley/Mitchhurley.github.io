        <p>My name is Mitchell Hurley, I am 19 years old, my pronouns are He/Him and I am a sophmore at UPS.</p> 
        <p>Some of my favorite things are: NBA basketball, Music (of all genres), Cyberbullying DJ Khaled, And More!</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love to do crossword puzzles, but I constantly cheat on them</p>
        <p> I was little, I would follow my dad to job sites he was working on as an architect. </p>
        <p>I would collect <em>rusty nails and broken glass</em> for fun. Not as cool as stamps or coins, but a lot more plentiful</p>
