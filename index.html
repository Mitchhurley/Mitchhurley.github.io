    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>My name is Mitchell Hurley, I am 19 years old, my pronouns are He/Him and I am a sophmore at UPS.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite things are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NBA basketball</li>
        <li>Music (of all genres)</li>
        <li>Cyberbullying DJ Khaled</li>
        <li>And More!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>More Hagiography</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I love to do crossword puzzles, but I constantly cheat on them</p>
    <p>When I was little, I would follow my dad to job sites he was working on as an architect. 
      I would collect <em>rusty nails and broken glass</em> for fun. Not as cool as stamps or coins, but a lot more plentiful</p>
